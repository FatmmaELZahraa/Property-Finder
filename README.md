DBMS_Property_Finder
The database model comprises strong entities Owner, Client, Property, and Location, interconnected through relationships like Owns, Makes, Transacts, and Has. Owners may have multiple properties, while clients can provide single reviews for properties but engage in multiple transactions with owners. Each property links to a single location, and the address details are uniquely associated. Assumptions include clients offering one review per property, detailed addresses for each location linked to a property, and the freedom for owners and clients to transact based on individual preferences or circumstances.
